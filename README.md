# <HORISEON Single Solution Services Module Challenge 1>

## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

User Story
    AS A marketing agency.
    I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards.
    SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

Acceptance Criteria 
    Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code.
    HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
    Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes.
    Heading attributes fall in sequential order.
    Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title.

## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![example image](assets/images/social-media-marketing.png)
    ```
